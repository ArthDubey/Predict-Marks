# Predict-Marks
This program tries to predict marks of a student based ONLY on a few factors. It uses a Dataset of students with their attributes and their marks. Warning- This is only indicative of the inclination.


# Aim

This project aims to build a software which can predict marks of a student purely based on statistical basis by employing a neural network to learn from the dataset of students with their attributes and marks.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository in your system and follow these steps-
1. Install requirements by

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

2. Run the file nn.py to train the neural network. (You can also skip this step to use already given weights and biases in repository)
```
python nn.py

```

3. Run the program nnc.py.
```
python nnc.py

```

4. Enjoy your results.


### Requirements
